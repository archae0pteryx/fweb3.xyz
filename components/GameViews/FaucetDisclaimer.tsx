      *Because a**holes spam our faucets to steal pennies worth of assets, we
      must turn them off sometimes. If this is the case for you just ping our
      #support channel and ask nicely for some tokens and MATIC. Please be
      patient. We wish we could always respond quickly but that&apos;s not
      always the case. We are a small group.
