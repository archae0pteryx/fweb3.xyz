      *Unfortunately folks try to abuse our faucets to steal pennies worth of
      assets, so we turn them off sometimes. If this is the case for you just
      ping our #support channel and ask nicely for some tokens and MATIC. Please
      be patient. There are only a few of us and not always in discord.
