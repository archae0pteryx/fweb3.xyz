        This is the final step. You&apos;re going to deploy your own code to the
        Polygon blockchain, just like we had to do to make this game.

      <p>
        So far, you have interfaced with **three** smart contracts we have
        deployed:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The ERC20 token for the 10,000,000 $FWEB3 tokens</li>
        <li>The ERC721 token for the Diamond NFT</li>
        <li>The scratch-made smart contract of the poll above</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Now you will deploy one of your own. Need help? Check out{' '}
